# Network neuroscience exercises

The folder contains 5 exercises on network neuroscience.
The first 4 exercises are aimed at learning the basic topological network measures, computing them in toy networks. These exercises can be performed on paper.
The 5th exercise is aimed at analyzing structural and functional connectomes and requires basic programming skills.

The folder is organized as follows:
* *networks* - folder containing MAT files for toy networks, structural and functional connectomes.
* *exercises.docx* - Word file containing a figure with the toy networks, the text of the exercises and a compact description of the solutions.
* *solutions.xlsx* - Excel file containing the procedure for solving the exercises on toy networks and a table of results on structural and functional connectomes.
* *compute_topological_measures.m* - MATLAB support function for computing the topological measures.
* *run_exercises_toy_networks.m* - MATLAB script for computing the topological measures on the toy networks.
* *run_exercises_connectomes.m* - MATLAB script for computing the topological measures on the structural and functional connectomes.
